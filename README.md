### About Me
Hello, my name is Nathan Denny and I'm currently an Aerospace Engineering Student at Iowa State University. I am in my third year here at Iowa State and am also pursuing a minor in Spanish. Outside of classes I enjoy playing the guitar, ukulele, and banjo. I also enjoy playing tennis and watching Premier League football (or soccer for the rest of you). 

My previous work experience includes about 10 months with the Iowa State University Center for Nondestructive Evaluation in their vibrothermography lab. I've also worked for Skach Manufacturing Company making blueprints for parts for about 2.5 years now. This summer I am excited to be joining Boeing in Everett, WA as a Data Science Engineering Intern.
